# Employee_Data_Analysis_exl

Introduction:
â€¢ You have been hired as a new data engineer at Analytixlabs. Your first major task is a data engineering project on employees of the one of the big corporation from the 1980s and 1995s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this project, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, import to HDFS/Hive, and perform analysis using Hive/Impala/Spark/SparkML using the data and create pipelines.

Objective :
There are three major steps for completing employee data analysis pipeline, each one has script file which uploaded here.

** STEPS **
1. Data Modeling , ER diagram 
  - create mysql table 
  - load csv file in created table 
    - prepare script file createtb_sql.sql
    - source createtb_sql.sql
2.Data Engineering 
  - create new directory in hdfs 
  - import data from mysql to hdfs using sqoop 
     - prepare script file shell_script.sh
     -sh shell_script.sh
 
  - create table in hive 
  - load data into created table 
     -prepare script hivefile 
    
3. Analysis the data in  impala 
4. Import data in pyspark 
5. EDA

-- ### According to given illustration , Majority of employees are in IT sector. Managers might churn regardingless of salary, There is high churn rate in manager designation at high salary.

6. Modelling 
- RandomForest  Classifier Algorithm is being used for this analysis if employee churn or not churn 
7. evaluation
- Accuracy, precision,recall,f1 score
