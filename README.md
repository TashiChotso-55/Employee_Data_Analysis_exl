# Employee_Data_Analysis_exl


Introduction:

â€¢ Employee churn is the overall turnover in an organization's staff as existing employees leave and new ones are hired. There are six csv files , 
 each content employees information.Based on those employee information such as , sex,date of birtth, number of projects, last_performance,
 hired date, salary , designation, and department; had buit predictive model with accuracy 89%.

Objective :
There are three major steps for completing employee data analysis pipeline, each one has script file which uploaded here.

** STEPS **
1. Data Modeling , ER diagram 
  - create mysql table 
  - load csv file in created table 
    - prepare script file createtb_sql.sql
    - source createtb_sql.sql
2.Data Engineering 
  - create new directory in hdfs 
  - import data from mysql to hdfs using sqoop 
     - prepare script file shell_script.sh
     -sh shell_script.sh
 
  - create table in hive 
  - load data into created table 
     -prepare script hivefile 
    
3. Analysis the data in  impala 
4. Import data in pyspark 
5. EDA
